    "1. <b>Any solution having a Python error will get zero points.</b> If you cannot solve a problem completely, it may be better to submit a clean partial solution having no errors rather than a solution having errors.\n",
    "2. Ensure that your solution is executed, the output is shown, and the cell execution sequence is consecutive.\n",
    "3. No external module can be used in this assignment. No Python features that have not been discussed in class may be used in a solution. For example, you may not use the if and while statements.  If not sure, ask me for clarification.\n",
    "4. Do not use input() unless it is required to make the solution interactive.\n",
    "5. Submit the final version of this Notebook file to Blackboard. Ensure that the file extension is .ipynb and it can be loaded into Jupyter Notebook. .json and .html files are not accepted."
