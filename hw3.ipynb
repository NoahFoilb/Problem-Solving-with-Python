    "1. <b>Any solution having a Python error will get zero points.</b> If you cannot solve a problem completely, it may be better to submit a clean partial solution having no errors rather than a solution having errors.\n",
    "2. Ensure that your solution is executed, the output is shown, and the cell execution sequence is consecutive.\n",
    "3. This assignment requires the turtle and math modules. No other external modules may be used. No Python features that have not been discussed in class may be used in a solution. If not sure, ask me for clarification.\n",
    "4. Solve each problem on a 640-by-480 Turtle screen. The screen title must show the problem number and your full name. Set the background color of the screen to a non-default color.\n",
    "5. Do not use input() unless it is required to make the solution interactive.\n",
    "6. Submit the final version of this Notebook file to Blackboard. Ensure that the file extension is .ipynb and it can be loaded into Jupyter Notebook. .json and .html files are not accepted."
