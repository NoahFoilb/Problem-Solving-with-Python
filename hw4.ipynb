    "1. <b>Any solution having a Python error will get zero points.</b> If you cannot solve a problem completely, it may be better to submit a clean partial solution having no errors rather than to submit a solution having errors.\n",
    "2. Ensure that your solution is executed, the output is shown, and the cell execution sequence is consecutive.\n",
    "3. Do not use the input function, list, or any other Python features that have not been fully covered according to the course schedule. Furthermore, do not import any modules for this assignment. If not sure, ask me for clarification.\n",
